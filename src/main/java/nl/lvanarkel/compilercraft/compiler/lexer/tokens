Chest: Integer value, with the contents of the chest being the value.
Fence gate: Boolean value, open is true, closed is false
Sign: Variable
    Block under=chest: Integer variable declaration, with value of chest= initial value
    Block under=fence gate: Boolean variable declaration, with value of fence gate=initial value
    Otherwise: Variable usage

Operators:

Iron ore: Addition (+)
Coal ore: Subtraction (-)

Lapis ore: Division (/)
... block: The assign operator e.g. Iron block = (+=)
